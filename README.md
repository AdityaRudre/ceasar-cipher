This program will help you to encode/decode the words by shifting it's order by given number.
<br/>
Suppose a word : "HELLO", we have to encode it in a such manner that no one will understand it. So in this program we will shift these aplphabets by certain numbers. for example shift number is : 5 then the alphabet 'H' will become 'M' and so on.
